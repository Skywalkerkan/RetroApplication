## How MVVM Works
- Data Fetching: The ViewModel interacts with the Model to retrieve data, often through network requests or database queries.

- Displaying Data: The ViewModel publishes data changes using @Published properties. SwiftUI automatically updates the View with this data.

- User Interaction: User interactions (e.g., button presses) are reported to the ViewModel, which then updates the Model.

- Reflecting Changes: Changes in the ViewModel are reflected in the View because the View observes the ViewModel using @ObservedObject or @StateObject.

- MVVM helps to keep code organized by separating data logic from the UI, making it more testable and easier to manage.
